    <h4>Why are snaps good for Rust projects?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Bundle all the runtime requirements, with support for multiple architectures.</li>
      <li>Simplify installation instructions, regardless of distribution, to snap install myrustapp.</li>
      <li>Extremely simple creation of services.</li>
      <li>No complex installation shell scripts to maintain.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>Programming in Rust can sometimes be difficult, especially when one of the crates in your project changes. Snaps let you bundle all the necessary dependencies without having to worry about breakages.</p>

<b>summary</b>: A fast CSV command line toolkit written in Rust
<b>description</b>: |
  xsv is a command line program for indexing, 
  slicing, analyzing, splitting and joining CSV 
  files. Commands should be simple, fast and 
  composable:
  - Simple tasks should be easy.
  - Performance trade offs should be exposed 
    in the CLI interface.
  - Composition should not come at the 
    expense of performance.
