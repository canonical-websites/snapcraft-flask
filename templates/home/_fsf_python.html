    <h4>Why are snaps good for Python projects?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Snaps are easy to discover and install. Millions of users can browse and install snaps graphically in the Snap Store or from the command-line.</li>
      <li>Snaps install and run the same across Linux. They bundle the exact version of Python required and all of your app’s dependencies, be they Python modules or system libraries.</li>
      <li>Snaps automatically update to the latest version. Four times a day, users’ systems will check for new versions and upgrade in the background.</li>
      <li>Upgrades are not disruptive. Because upgrades are not in-place, users can keep your app open as it’s upgraded in the background.</li>
      <li>Upgrades are safe. If your app fails to upgrade, users automatically roll back to the previous revision.</li>
    </ul>
